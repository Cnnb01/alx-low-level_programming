### 0x14-bit_manipulation

Bit manipulation in C involves working with individual bits in binary representations of data. This topic likely covers operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and masking, which can be used to manipulate and extract specific bits within variables.

Here's a basic overview of some common bit manipulation operations:

#### Bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) Operators:
- Bitwise AND (`&`) compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set if and only if both corresponding bits in the operands are set.

- Bitwise OR (`|`) compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is set.

- Bitwise XOR (`^`) compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set if only one of the corresponding bits in the operands is set.

#### Bitwise Shift Operators (`<<` and `>>`):
- Left Shift (`<<`) shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the integer by 2 to the power of the shift amount.

- Right Shift (`>>`) shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing the integer by 2 to the power of the shift amount.

#### Bit Masking:
Bit masking involves using bitwise AND and OR operations to isolate or modify specific bits within an integer. For example, you can use a mask to clear or set specific bits to 0 or 1.

These bit manipulation operations are often used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and when dealing with binary representations of data.
